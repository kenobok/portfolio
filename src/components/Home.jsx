                        <p>
                            With over 3 years of experience in crafting innovative web applications, 
                            Iâ€™ve honed a versatile skill set that allows me to seamlessly contribute 
                            to every aspect of a web project. My expertise spans front-end technologies 
                            such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React.js), as well as back-end development 
                            using Python (Django, Django Rest Framework), and efficient database management 
                            with SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL).<br/><br/>

                            I am committed to writing clean, maintainable code and prioritizing the user experience. 
                            I aim at building intuitive, responsive websites that not only meet user needs but also 
                            deliver tangible results. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, 
                            I focus on creating powerful, scalable digital experiences that drive success and add value.
